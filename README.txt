This folder contains the code for the OTL approach published at Neurocomputing, the exact being ‘’Online multimodal dictionary learning’’. To run the code, it is necessary to install properly Python 3, the tensor tool TensorLy as well as mxnet. The folder named ‘’CodeexampleOTL’’ contains examples explaining how to use our method with the different constraints (positivity, unconstrained or orthogonality).
